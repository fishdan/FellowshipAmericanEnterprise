Review progress.ai and the speckit files and tell me what we should be working on next. 
Continuously update progress.ai as if you were a secretary recording all the decisions we implement. 
Make sure we always honor our speckit constitution. 
Tell me whenever you think we can mark a spec-kit task complete. 
Encourage me to not do work that isn't defined in a speckit task.
