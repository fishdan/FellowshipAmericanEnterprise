# Fellowship for American Enterprise — Nonprofit Formation Repository

This repo is the single source of truth for forming and operating the Fellowship for American Enterprise as a North Carolina 501(c)(3). It contains governance documents, policies, compliance artifacts, and SpecKit specs/plans/tasks to guide formation.

## Getting Started
- Set `CODEX_HOME` before using Codex CLI in this repo: `export CODEX_HOME=$(pwd)/.codex`.
- Specs and plans live in `.specify/`; official documents and templates live under `documents/`.
- Use PRs for all governance documents and policies; require board/officer approval before merge.

## Key Artifacts
- `.specify/constitution.md`: Nonprofit constitution and governance principles.
- `.specify/specs/001-nonprofit-formation.md`: Formation requirements.
- `.specify/plans/001-nonprofit-formation.md`: Operational blueprint.
- `.specify/tasks/001-nonprofit-formation.md`: Volunteer-ready tasks.
- `documents/`: Drafts/placeholders for Articles, bylaws, policies, board records, IRS/EIN, and compliance materials.

## Open Decisions
- Tracked in the spec: registered agent/address, initial directors/officers, fiscal year, banking, and 1023-EZ eligibility.
