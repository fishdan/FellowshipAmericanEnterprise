## Purpose
To protect the Corporation’s interests when it contemplates any transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private interest of an officer or director, and to ensure decisions are made in furtherance of the Corporation’s charitable mission without undue influence or private inurement.

## Covered Persons
- Directors, officers, key volunteers assigned fiduciary duties, and any individual with delegated authority over significant financial or contractual decisions.

## Definition of Conflict
A conflict exists when a Covered Person has a financial or personal interest that could impair objectivity or create the appearance of bias in decisions affecting the Corporation. This includes related-party transactions, compensation decisions, vendor selection, grants, or benefits to entities in which the Covered Person has an interest.

## Duty to Disclose
- Covered Persons must disclose actual or potential conflicts to the Board (or designated committee) promptly and update disclosures annually.
- Disclosures must include the nature of the interest, related parties, and any material facts.

## Determining Whether a Conflict Exists
- The disinterested directors review the disclosure and relevant facts.
- The Covered Person may present information but must leave deliberations and voting.
- The Board determines by majority of disinterested directors whether a conflict exists.

## Procedures for Addressing a Conflict
1. The Board or committee may investigate alternatives to the proposed arrangement.
2. If a more advantageous arrangement is not reasonably attainable, the Board may approve the transaction if it is fair, reasonable, and in the Corporation’s best interests.
3. Approval requires a majority vote of disinterested directors, with recusals noted in minutes.

## Records of Proceedings
Minutes must document:
- Names of persons disclosing conflicts and the nature of the conflict.
- Facts considered, alternatives reviewed, and comparability data (if applicable).
- Recusal and abstention from deliberation and vote.
- The Board’s decision and rationale.

## Compensation
- A director who receives compensation from the Corporation for services is precluded from voting on matters pertaining to that compensation but may provide information as requested.

## Annual Statements
- Each Covered Person shall sign an annual statement affirming that they:
  - Have received, read, and understand this policy and the Corporation’s mission and constitution.
  - Agree to comply with the policy.
  - Disclose potential conflicts and relationships.

## Periodic Reviews
- The Board shall conduct periodic reviews to ensure compliance with this policy, including evaluating transactions for reasonableness and adherence to exempt purposes.

## Violations
- If the Board has reason to believe a Covered Person has failed to disclose a conflict, it shall inform the person and afford an opportunity to explain. If a violation is found, the Board may take corrective action, including removal consistent with law and bylaws.

## Related Policies and Records
- Related documents include the Bylaws, Document Retention Policy, and board minutes. All disclosures and determinations shall be retained in the repository per the retention policy.
