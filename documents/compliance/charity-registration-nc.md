Title: North Carolina Charity Registration Steps  
Version: v0.1  
Status: draft  
Spec: 001-nonprofit-formation  
Last-Updated: 2024-12-09  
Alignment: NC Charitable Solicitation Licensing (CSL)

## Overview
North Carolina requires most charities soliciting contributions from NC residents to obtain a Charitable Solicitation License (CSL) through the NC Secretary of State (Charitable Solicitation Licensing Section), unless exempt.

## Exemption Check (confirm before filing)
- Potential exemptions (examples; verify current rules):  
  - Charities expecting to receive ≤ $50,000 in contributions AND all-volunteer (no paid staff/solicitors).  
  - Religious organizations or educational institutions meeting statutory definitions.  
  - Certain membership organizations soliciting only members.  
- Action: Determine projected contributions and paid staffing. If exempt, file exemption form; otherwise proceed with full license application.

## Required Information/Attachments (for full CSL application)
- Formation documents: Filed Articles of Incorporation (NC) and Bylaws.  
- IRS: EIN (required); IRS determination letter if available (may submit post-issuance if pending).  
- Financials: Current or projected budget; if operational history exists, provide most recent financial statements or Form 990 (if filed).  
- Officers/Directors: Names, titles, addresses.  
- Registered agent/principal office: Name and address in NC.  
- Fundraising: Disclosure of professional fundraisers or fundraising counsel (if any).  
- Program description: Brief narrative of charitable purpose/activities (align with mission).  
- Contact info: Primary contact for the filing.

## Filing Method
- Preferred: Online portal via NC Secretary of State (Charitable Solicitation Licensing).  
- Alternative: Paper submission (check current address/instructions).  
- Fee: Based on contributions; baseline fee typically starts around $50 (verify current fee schedule).  
- Payment: Online payment or check/money order if paper.

## Steps
1) Confirm exemption status; if exempt, complete and submit exemption form with supporting documentation.  
2) If not exempt:  
   - Compile Articles, Bylaws, EIN, director/officer list, program description, financials/budget, and fundraiser disclosures.  
   - Complete CSL application via portal (or paper).  
   - Pay required fee.  
3) Track submission confirmation and license number.  
4) Store a copy of the submitted application and proof of payment in the repository (`documents/compliance/`), omitting sensitive personal info.  
5) Add renewal deadline to compliance calendar (`documents/compliance/compliance-calendar.md`).

## Renewals and Reporting
- Annual renewal required; due date set by CSL issuance (often tied to fiscal year end or license issue date).  
- Provide updated financials (Form 990 or equivalent) and pay renewal fee based on contributions.  
- Update any changes to officers, addresses, fundraising counsel, or program scope.

## Disclosures
- Include required NC solicitation disclosure statement in fundraising materials once licensed or exempted, per CSL guidance.

## Open Items to Finalize
- Confirm exemption eligibility (projected contributions and staffing).  
- Confirm registered agent and addresses.  
- Confirm financial projections and program description for the application.  
- Add renewal cadence and contact responsible person to the compliance calendar.
